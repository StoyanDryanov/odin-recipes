# odin-recipes
In this project I will be using some HTML to create a page for recipes
and a seperate page for each recipe!
In this project I will be showcasing some basic HTML including
bold or italic paragraphs,
h1 tags,
creating unordered lists(ul) and ordered lists(ol),
making links,
and showing images.
